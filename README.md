# crystalCollectorGame

This is a simple game based on HTML,CSS,Bootstrap, JS and JQuery. At load of the page a random number is generated.
Four crystal buttons are generated with psuedo random values guaranteed to give the user at least a chance to win.
The object of the game is to click the crystals until the user value equals the random number. The user number will
increment based on user selected crystal values. If the user goes over or wins the game resets and generates a new
random number for the number to guess and all 4 crystal values.
